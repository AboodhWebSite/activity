<p>The State of Palestine, also known simply as Palestine, is a de jure sovereign state in the Middle East with Jerusalem as its capital. It is recognized by 141 UN members. Since 2012 it has non-member observer state in the United Nations. This amounts to a de facto, or implicit, recognition of statehood.</p>

<u><h2 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">Troubles of Palastine</h2></u>

<p>In 1947-8, 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from or fled their homes at the hands of militias during the creation of the state of Israel. Hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages were emptied of their populations and destroyed. This tragedy is known as the ‘Nakba’ by Palestinians, and heralded decades of displacement, conflict, and persecution.During the July war of 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza, and annexed East Jerusalem. For more than 54 years, Israel’s military occupation has impacted every aspect of daily life for Palestinians: restricting movement, imposing discriminatory control, and threatening homes and livelihoods. Palestinians in Gaza have also lived under 14 years of stifling blockade, collective punishment and repeated military assault.</p>
